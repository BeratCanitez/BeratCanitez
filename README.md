👋 Hi, I’m Berat Canitez

🎓 Computer Engineering student at Cankaya University (3rd year)
💻 Interested in software development, computer vision, and system design

I have hands on experience with C, C++, and Python, and I enjoy working on projects that involve
image processing, OCR based systems, and real world problem solving.

I have worked on automation and computer vision projects using OpenCV and EasyOCR, and I have
experience collaborating in team based environments, including leading a small development team
during my internship.

🚀 Currently focusing on:

* Python based automation and computer vision projects
